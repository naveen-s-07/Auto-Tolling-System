# ðŸš— Auto Tolling System â€“ Number Plate Based Toll Collection

Welcome to the Auto Tolling System! This project is all about making toll collection faster and smarter. Instead of stopping every vehicle to collect tolls, our system uses a camera to capture the vehicleâ€™s number plate, reads the plate using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and logs the toll automatically.

## ðŸ’¡ Why this project?

Manual toll collection is slow and can lead to long queues. With the growing number of vehicles, automation is the need of the hour. This project helps:
- Reduce waiting time at toll booths
- Minimize human errors
- Improve traffic flow

- Detects vehicle number plates from images or video
- Reads the number using OCR (Tesseract)
- Automatically logs the entry with time and date
- Stores the toll collection data
